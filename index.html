                About me: I was born and raised in beautiful California. Grew up my whole 
                life around the beaches of Santa Barbara. I have a background in Literature
                and Philosophy. My roots are from North Africa, the lands of the olive and 
                the mediterranean sea. I owe my love of travel, to being a first generation 
                amaerican, and having family all around the world.

                My passion: I am someone with many passions, but one of my biggest passions 
                is my love for coffee. I love trying beans from all over the world. Anytime 
                I travel to a new place, I always like to find the best coffee in town and 
                take a bag back with me to brew in my coffee lab. One of my proud possessions 
                is my coffee station. It has various brewing devices from all around the world.

            <div class="div-3">
                Fun fact: Did you know that coffee originated in Ethiopia?! There are thousands 
                of coffee bean varrietals. It is the only place in the world where coffee grows
                natively. Legend has it that a goat herder, named of Kaldi, found his goats eating 
                cherries that had them wound up with endless energy. He showed it to some local 
                monks who eventually figured out how to brew it!
